    <h2>My extracurriculars</h2>
    <p>Outside of my education, I play tennis, go to the gym daily and run a hair business.<br>
       My hair business is called Prince$$ Treatment and I launched it in December 2022. It <br>
       required a lot of time, effort and creativity in order to help it succeed but I enjoy it <br>
       nevertheless. Balancing my extracurriculars with my education and social life have really <br>
       helped to hone my transferrble skills such as time mnagment, project planning, customer <br>
       service, dedication, resilience an many more to help me become the strong independant <br>
       woman that I am today, who does not shy away from any challenges.
