    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>Hi there! My name's Princess and I'm curretnly and undergraduate computer science student. <br>
       Before now, I used to want to work in healthcare, I cchanged my mind from GP to paediatrcian <br>
       to optometrist to audiologist, so I've been on quite a long journey haha. Whilst getting work <br>
       volunteering at my local hospital, I came to realise that technology truly forms the basis of <br>
       everything, and just how amazing it is. Eventually, I came to the conclusion that the hospital <br>
       environment wasn't really for me and that I could contribute to our community in more ways than <br>
       just working in a healthcare profession
       </br>
       </br>
       </br>
       </br>
       </br>
    </br></p>

    <p> I began to appreciate the complexity of technology and would find myself wanting <br>
        to find out more about how AI is used in healthcare and how seemingly small and <br>
        simple computers could store information about hundreds of patients. I guess this <br>
        is where my love for technology really begn to grow! Since then, I have taught <br>
        mysef some python and java and even attended mini coding workships, bootcamps <br>
        and technology networking events. Some things I have attended include:
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>
    </br></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Bright Network diversity and inclusion event</li>
        <li>Boolean Coding week</li>
        <li>JP Morgan software engineering virtual internship</li>

    <h2>My extrcurriculars</h2>
    <p>Outside of my education, I play tennis, go to the gym daily and run a hair business.<br>
       My hair business is called Prince$$ Treatment and I launched it in December 2022. It <br>
       required a lot of time, effort and creativity in order to help it succeed but I enjoy it <br>
       nevertheless. Balancing my extracurriculars with my education and social life have really <br>
       helped to hone my transferrble skills such as time mnagment, project planning, customer <br>
       service, dedication, resilience an many more to help me become the strong independant <br>
       woman that I am today, who does not shy away from any challenges.
