    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>Hi there! My name's Princess and I'm curretnly and undergraduate computer science student. <br>
       Before now, I used to want to work in healthcare, I cchanged my mind from GP to paediatrcian <br>
       to optometrist to audiologist, so I've been on quite a long journey haha. Whilst getting work <br>
       experience volunteering at my local hospital, I came to realise that technology truly forms the basis <br>
       of everything, and just how amazing it is. Eventually, I came to the conclusion that the hospital <br>
       environment wasn't really for me and that I could contribute to our community in more ways than <br>
       just working in a healthcare profession.
       </br>

    <p> I began to appreciate the complexity of technology and would find myself wanting <br>
        to find out more about how AI is used in healthcare and how seemingly small and <br>
        simple computers could store information about hundreds of patients. I guess this <br>
        is where my love for technology really begn to grow! Since then, I have taught <br>
        mysef some python and java and even attended mini coding workships, bootcamps <br>
        and technology networking events. Some things I have attended include:
